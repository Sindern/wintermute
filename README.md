### Security & Voice Commands (RasPi3)

Working on setting up a repo that I can clone to a raspi for an out-of-the-box security system similar to a nest camera.  

##### Security Cam 
* Using '[motion](http://lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome)' for auto-detection of motion to start taking photos.
* Images are backed up via [rclone](https://rclone.org/) to a configured service. (Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon Cloud Drive, etc)  This should protect the images in case of damage or loss of the hardware.

##### Voice Commands & TTS
* Under Construction. ;3
